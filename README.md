title: "About me"
---

Hi folks! I am Max, a Ph.D. candidate at the the University of Queensland, Australia. [CV](files\cv.pdf)

<img src = "files/bday2021.png" style = "width: 30%">

I am passionate about research, particularly regarding applied economics and its intersection with other disciplines such as geography, environmental sciences, psychology, and beyond. I enjoy mathematical models and using advanced econometrics methods in R. My motivation is the plethora of knowledge and skills I would love to acquire, the unresolved questions, and those questions that are yet to be asked.

My hobbies are sports: tennis, soccer, cycling, and table tennis. I also enjoy craft beers, Stouts and IPA are my favourite styles.

A list of the scientific publications I have co-authored:
